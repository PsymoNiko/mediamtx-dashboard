## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Setting up Your Environment)

The `mediamtx-dashboard` relies on **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **pnpm** for development, and **Docker** for containerized testing.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Git**
2.  **Node.js** (LTS version)
3.  **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
4.  **Docker** & **Docker Compose**

### Installation

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mediamtx-dashboard.git
    cd mediamtx-dashboard
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** using pnpm workspaces:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
4.  **Start the local development environment** (including a MediaMTX instance) using the provided development Docker Compose file:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
    ```
5.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
